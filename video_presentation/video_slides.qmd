## Stroke: A Global Health Emergency

The Problem:

```         
â€¢   15M strokes/year (WHO): 5M deaths, 5M disabilities.
â€¢   Stroke disrupts brain blood flow: caused by blockage or bleeding.
```

Project Goals:

```         
â€¢   Predict stroke risk using data.
â€¢   Analyze key factors like age, heart disease, & lifestyle.
â€¢   Visualize insights for better understanding.
```

Key Question:

What factors best predict stroke, and how can we intervene?

## Dataset Overview

Data Source

```         
    â€¢   Origin: Found on Kaggle.com. Owned and last updated in 2020 by Federico Soriano Palacios.
    â€¢   Observations: 5110
    â€¢   Features: 11
```

Key Variables

```         
    â€¢   Target Variable: stroke (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
    â€¢   Demographics: gender, age, Residence_type
    â€¢   Health Metrics: hypertension, heart_disease, avg_glucose_level, bmi
    â€¢   Lifestyle: smoking_status, work_type, ever_married
```

```{r, warning=FALSE}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Click to show code"

# Original Dataset
#kable(stroke_tb)

```

## Data Transformations

Before preprocessing:

```         
Dataset is fairly clean
    â€¢   No duplicate rows.
    â€¢   Missing values in bmi and smoking_status.
```

After data transformations:

```         
Variable Adjustments:
â€¢   Reclassified variables: bmi â†’ numerical; hypertension, heart_disease â†’ categorical.
â€¢   Removed irrelevant column: id.

Handling Missing Values:
â€¢   Replaced missing values: bmi â†’ median, smoking_status â†’ mode.

Outlier Analysis:
â€¢   Visualized outliers in age, avg_glucose_level, and bmi using boxplots.
â€¢   Outliers Identified:
â€¢   avg_glucose_level: 12.25% of dataset (627 points).
â€¢   bmi: 2.47% of dataset(126 points).
â€¢   Retained outliers for now due to potential relevance as risk factors.

Categorical Variables:
â€¢   Removed infrequent categories in gender (Other) and work_type (Never_worked).
â€¢   Noted rare occurrences in heart_disease, hypertension, and stroke.
```

```{r, warning=FALSE}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Click to show code"
#colSums(stroke_tb == "Unknown" | stroke_tb == "N/A" | stroke_tb == "")
```
