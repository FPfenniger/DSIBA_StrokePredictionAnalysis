## Understanding Stroke: A Data-Driven Approach

### Stroke: A Global Health Emergency

The Problem:

```         
â€¢   15M strokes/year (WHO): 5M deaths, 5M disabilities.
â€¢   Stroke disrupts brain blood flow: caused by blockage or bleeding.
```

Project Goals:

```         
â€¢   Predict stroke risk using data.
â€¢   Analyze key factors like age, heart disease, & lifestyle.
â€¢   Visualize insights for better understanding.
```

Key Question:

What factors best predict stroke, and how can we intervene?

## Data
### Stroke Prediction Dataset Overview

Data Source

	â€¢	Origin: Kaggleâ€™s Stroke Prediction Dataset
	â€¢	Observations: 5110
	â€¢	Features: 12 (including binary target variable stroke)
	â€¢	Usage: Educational purposes only; source details are confidential.

Key Variables

	â€¢	Target Variable: stroke (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
	â€¢	Demographics: gender, age, Residence_type
	â€¢	Health Metrics: hypertension, heart_disease, avg_glucose_level, bmi
	â€¢	Lifestyle: smoking_status, work_type, ever_married

### Data Preprocessing

	â€¢	Dataset Owner: Federico Soriano Palacios
	â€¢	Last Updated: 4 years ago
	â€¢	Preprocessing Note: bmi converted to numeric.

	1.	Data Overview:
	â€¢	Dataset is clean with no duplicate rows.
	â€¢	Missing values in bmi and smoking_status.
	2.	Variable Adjustments:
	â€¢	Reclassified variables: bmi â†’ numerical; hypertension, heart_disease â†’ categorical.
	â€¢	Removed irrelevant column: id.
	3.	Handling Missing Values:
	â€¢	Replaced missing values: bmi â†’ median, smoking_status â†’ mode.
	4.	Outlier Analysis:
	â€¢	Visualized outliers in age, avg_glucose_level, and bmi using boxplots.
	â€¢	Outliers Identified:
	â€¢	avg_glucose_level: 12.25% (627 points).
	â€¢	bmi: 2.47% (126 points).
	â€¢	Retained outliers for now due to potential relevance as risk factors.
	5.	Categorical Variables:
	â€¢	Removed infrequent categories in gender (Other) and work_type (Never_worked).
	â€¢	Noted rare occurrences in heart_disease, hypertension, and stroke.
