	•	Stroke disrupts brain blood flow: caused by blockage or bleeding.

Project Goals:

	•	Predict stroke risk using data.
	•	Analyze key factors like age, heart disease, & lifestyle.
	•	Visualize insights for better understanding.

Key Question:

What factors best predict stroke, and how can we intervene?
	
## Data preprocessing

## Exploratory data analysis

When you click the **Render** button a presentation will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

## Predictive model

## Model evaluation

## Conclusion
