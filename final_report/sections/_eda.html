<p>Based on the summary table for numerical variables and the histogram, we can observe the following descriptive characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>age</code>: The dataset includes individuals with ages ranging from 0.08 to 82 years, with an average age of 43.23 years but a peak around 57 years, a second peak around 78 years, and a standard deviation of 22.61 years.</li>
<li><code>avg_glucose_level</code>: We can observe a right-skewed bimodal distribution with a mean of 106.15 and a standard deviation of 45.28. The average glucose levels range from 55.12 to 271.74 mg/dL.</li>
<li><code>bmi</code>: The histogram shows a right-skewed distribution with a mean of 28.86 and a standard deviation of 7.85. The BMI values range from 10.3 to 97.6.</li>
</ul>
<p>For completeness we added some violin plots of the numerical variables.</p>

<p>The histogram and violin charts have been grouped by stroke occurrence. This allows us to observe the distribution of the data for each variable in relation to the target variable <code>stroke</code>. Based on the charts, <code>age</code> and <code>avg_glucose_level</code> exhibit notable differences in the proportions of stroke cases across their value ranges. Stroke cases are more frequent at higher glucose levels and in the age range of 60 to 80 years.</p>
<p>The variable <code>age</code> shows a weak positive relationship with the target variable <code>stroke</code> (correlation coefficient of 0.24). <code>avg_glucose_level</code> shows an even weaker positive relationship with the target variable (correlation coefficient of 0.13). In contrast, <code>bmi</code> and <code>stroke</code> show no relationship with a correlation coefficient of 0.04.</p>

<p>Relevant differences in the proportions of stroke cases can be observed across the levels of the following categorical variables:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>smoking_status</code>: The proportion of stroke cases is highest among individuals who formerly smoked, compared to those who never smoked or currently smoke. This relationship could be influenced by age, as individuals who formerly smoked may be older on average. Current smokers show a slightly higher proportion of stroke cases than those who never smoked.</li>
<li><code>hypertension</code>: Individuals with hypertension have a higher proportion of stroke cases compared to those without hypertension.</li>
<li><code>ever_married</code>: Married individuals show a higher proportion of stroke cases compared to those who have never been married. This relationship might be influenced by age, as younger individuals are less likely to be married, and the risk of stroke typically increases with age.</li>
<li><code>work_type</code>: The proportion of stroke cases varies across work types, with private sector employees and self-employed individuals exhibiting higher proportions of stroke cases than individuals in other work categories.</li>
<li><code>heart disease</code>: Individuals with heart disease have a higher proportion of stroke cases compared to those without heart disease.</li>
</ul>
<p>In contrast, the following variables appear to be not relevant, as there are no differences in the proportions of stroke cases across their levels (see Appendix):</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>gender</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>Residence_type</code></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the univariate analysis, <code>heart_disease</code>, <code>smoking_status</code>, <code>hypertension</code>, <code>ever_married</code>, and <code>work_type</code> could be potential candidates for further exploration and modeling among the categorical variables. These variables exhibit notable differences in the proportions of stroke cases across their levels, suggesting they may be important predictors of stroke risk. Among the numerical variables, <code>age</code> and <code>avg_glucose_level</code> show a weak to very weak positive relationship with the target variable <code>stroke</code>, suggesting they may also be important predictors of stroke risk. These predictors may even become more relevant when examined in a balanced dataset, which our initial hypotheses would suggest.</p>

<p>Our numerical features don’t seem to be strongly correlated with each other. The strongest correlation is observed between <code>age</code> and <code>bmi</code> (0.324), which is not surprising, as BMI is often used as a measure of body fat and is known to increase with age. The correlation between the other numerical features is rather low. We can therefore safely assume independence of our numerical features. A further examination of the categorical features for collinearity will be done in the final data preparation in the next part.</p>

<p><code>age</code> and <code>avg_glucose_level</code> have very different summary statistics. The median age in the balanced dataset increased by 14 years to 59 years, up from 45 years in the original dataset. The median average glucose level is 96,84 mg/dL, with only slight increase from 91,89 mg/dL. The median bmi stays the same as the original dataset.</p>

<p>Now incorporating the balanced dataset, the univariate analysis of categorical variables such as <code>heart_disease</code>, <code>smoking_status</code>, <code>hypertension</code>, <code>ever_married</code>, and <code>work_type</code> will be re-examined to observe differences. These variables previously showed notable disparities in the proportions of stroke cases across their levels in the original dataset, indicating their potential as predictors of stroke risk. Visualizing these variables with the balanced dataset will help identify any shifts in patterns and strengthen their relevance for further exploration and modeling.</p>

<li><p><code>ever_married</code>: Looking at the balanced barplots for the categorical variables, around 58% of individuals that have ever been married had experienced a stroke, while only around 25% for those who have never been.</p></li>
<li><p><code>work_type</code>: Around 6% of individuals with a work type <code>children</code> have experienced a stroke. As the data source of the dataset does not states clearly that work type <code>children</code> means that the individual is a child, we cannot confirm that it makes sense because children experience less stroke. For the tree other categories, the proportion of individuals that have experienced a stroke is between 50% to 65%.</p></li>
<li><p><code>smoking_status</code>: The tree categories of this variable show proportions of stroke between 40% to 65%, which suggest that the dataset is balanced as we want.</p></li>
<li><p><code>hypertension</code>: Around 75% of individuals who have hypertension experienced a stroke, while only around 45% for those who don’t have hypertension.</p></li>
<li><p><code>heart_disease</code>: Around 80% of individuals who have a heart disease had a stroke. While around 45% for those who don’t.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For the variables <code>hypertension</code> and <code>heart_disease</code>, this noticeable difference is explained by the disproportion of individuals not having hypertension (around 82.2%) and not having a heart_disease (around 87.86%).</p>

<p>To go deeper in the analysis of the numerical variables of the balanced dataset, we create their violinplots. This will allow us to observe the distribution of the data for each variable in relation to the target variable <code>stroke</code></p>
<p>As for the violin plots of the initial datasets, stroke cases are more frequent at higher glucose levels and in the age range of 60 to 80 years. The proportions of stroke cases vary significantly across the different value ranges of age and avg_glucose_level.</p>
<p>The balancing indicate more pronounced relationships between these variables and stroke occurrences. The strong positive correlation between age and stroke, which increased to 0.58 from 0.24, suggests that as age rises, so does the likelihood of experiencing a stroke. This enhancement may stem from balancing the dataset, which equalized the number of individuals with strokes and those without, thereby reducing biases caused by an uneven distribution across age groups and clarifying the association. Similarly, the correlation between average glucose levels and stroke strengthened to 0.26, up from 0.13, potentially highlighting a clearer link between higher glucose levels and stroke risk. Lastly, the correlation for <code>bmi</code> rose slightly to 0.09 from 0.04.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="stratified-dataset-analysis">Stratified Dataset Analysis</h2>
<p>In our previous EDA we observed that <code>age</code> is the strongest predictor for <code>stroke</code>. To ensure that our model is not biased towards the age distribution in the dataset, we will perform stratified sampling based on the age variable. We will create two age groups (one group composed of individuals below 60, the other one composed of individuals of 60 and over) and ensure that the distribution of these groups is similar in both the training and test datasets.</p>
<p>The decision to use 60 years as the cutoff is clinically significant for several reasons. Research indicates that the risk of stroke markedly increases with age, particularly after 60, meaning that this age threshold allows us to focus our analysis on populations that are most affected by this condition. Furthermore, individuals over 60 often experience biological changes that can influence stroke risk factors, such as increased incidence of hypertension, changes in blood vessel elasticity, and the onset of other comorbidities. By stratifying at this age, we can capture these critical differences in risk profiles, leading to more precise analysis</p>
<p>Looking at the violin plot for individuals that have experienced a stroke, the average age is 67.73 years. We have arbitrarily chosen to divide the dataset into two age groups at age 60 for several reasons.</p>
<p>With this sampling method, we hope to increase our model’s generalizability and robustness in the section.</p>

<p>Looking at the numerical variables summary and at the histograms for individuals below 60 years old, we find that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>age</code>: The dataset includes individuals with ages ranging from 0.08 to 59 years, with an average age of 33.13 years (versus 43.35 years old for the full dataset). The median decrease to 35 years old (versus 45 years old for the full dataset). This is a 10 years decrease for the median !</p></li>
<li><p><code>avg_glucose_level</code>: The histogram of this variable still shows a right-skewed bimodal distribution. The mean of average glucose level slightly decrease to 100.36 mg/dL (versus 106.18 mg/dL) and the same goes for the median, which drops to 90.39 mg/dL (versus 91.89 mg/dL).</p></li>
<li><p><code>bmi</code>: The histogram shows a right-skewed distribution. The mean of 28.52 exhibits minimal fluctuation (versus 28.88), the same applies to the median of 27.70 (versus 28.10).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Same as for the balanced dataset analysis, we create some violin plots for the numerical variables to get a better view of these variables.</p>

<p>Looking at the correlation coefficients, we notice that the correlation between <code>age</code> and <code>stroke</code> drops to 0.14 (versus 0.24 for the full dataset). The same goes for the correlation between <code>avg_glucose_level</code> and <code>stroke</code> which 0.07 (versus 0.13 for the full dataset). The correlation between <code>bmi</code> and <code>stroke</code> stays extremely low 0.06 (versus 0.04). The correlations drop with the target variable <code>stroke</code> after stratification for individuals below 60 suggest that while age and glucose levels are known risk factors for stroke, their influence may be less pronounced among younger individuals.</p>

<p>Looking at the numerical variables summary and at the histograms for individuals of 60 and over years old, we find that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>age</code>: The dataset includes individuals with ages ranging from 60 to 82 years, with an average age of 70.9 years (versus 43.35 years old for the full dataset). The median increase to 71 years old (versus 45 years old for the full dataset). This is a 26 years increase for the median !</p></li>
<li><p><code>avg_glucose_level</code>: The histogram of this variable still shows a right-skewed bimodal distribution. The mean of average glucose level slightly increase to 121.9 mg/dL (versus 106.18 mg/dL) and the same goes for the median, which rise to 96.97 mg/dL (versus 91.89 mg/dL).</p></li>
<li><p><code>bmi</code>: The histogram shows a right-skewed distribution. The mean of 29.85 exhibits minimal fluctuation (versus 28.88), the same applies to the median of 27.70 (versus 28.80).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Same as for individuals below 60 years old, here are the violin plots for individuals of 60 and over years old:</p>

<p>Even tough the proportions of stroke cases across the different value ranges of <code>age</code>, does not vary as much as the group below 60 years old, we still see a clear distribution of stroke towards older individuals. Individuals between 75 and 80 years old seem to experience stroke more.</p>

<p>Looking at the correlation coefficients, we notice that the correlation between <code>age</code> and <code>stroke</code> drops to 0.17 (versus 0.24 for the full dataset). The same goes for the correlation between <code>avg_glucose_level</code> and <code>stroke</code> which 0.10 (versus 0.13 for the full dataset). The correlation coefficient between <code>bmi</code> and <code>stroke</code> becomes negative -0.04 (versus 0.04) but stays extremely low and indicate that BMI is not a strong predictor of stroke in individuals of 60 and over years old.</p>
<p>For the variable <code>age</code>, the reduction of the correlation coefficient may suggest that while age remains an important risk factor for stroke, its predictive power diminishes within a narrower age range, possibly due to the high baseline incidence of stroke in this group, which can obscure the strength of the correlation with age alone.</p>
<p>Similarly, the correlation between <code>avg_glucose_level</code> and <code>stroke</code> decreases from 0.13 in the full dataset to 0.10 for individuals aged 60 and over. This decline implies that glucose levels, while still relevant, may play a somewhat less significant role in stroke risk within this specific age group. It may reflect the fact that at advanced ages, other age-related risk factors or comorbid conditions could overshadow the impact of glucose levels.</p>

<li><p><code>hypertension</code>: Same as for the group of individuals below 60 years old, individuals who have hypertension have a higher proportion of stroke (17.91%) than those who don’t (11.85%).</p></li>
<li><p><code>heart_disease</code>: Same as for the group of individuals below 60 years old, individuals who have a heart disease have a higher proportion of stroke (20.09%) than those who don’t (11.88%).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For readability reasons, we do not present the plots for the variables <code>gender</code>, <code>Residence_type</code>, <code>smoking_status</code> and <code>work_type</code> as the proportions of stroke appear to be consistent across the categories they comprise (See Appendix for reference).</p>
