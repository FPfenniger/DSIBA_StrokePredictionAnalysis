# Introduction

## Overview and Motivation

Stroke is a leading global health issue, causing long-term disability and claiming millions of lives each year. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 15 million people worldwide experience a stroke annually, with 5 million deaths and an additional 5 million left with permanent disabilities[^1]. A stroke is a medical emergency that occurs when blood flow to a part of the brain is interrupted, depriving brain cells of oxygen and nutrients and causing them to die. This disruption can be caused by a blockage (ischemic stroke) or by bleeding in the brain (hemorrhagic stroke). The impact is particularly significant given that strokes can lead to loss of mobility, speech, and cognitive function, affecting individuals’ quality of life and creating burdens for families and communities.

This project on strokes is driven by several key motivations. One of the most compelling reasons is that, according to the American Heart Association, approximately 80% of strokes are preventable through appropriate preventive measures[^2]. This statistic motivates us to identify and analyze risk factors, as we have the potential to significantly reduce the incidence of this disease.

Our project has several goals, as outlined below :

1)  Build a predictive model for stroke occurrence based on risk factors

2)  Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand the trends and relationships between risk factors and stroke incidence

3)  Create visualizations to illustrate the results and enhance the understanding of stroke risk factors

We will implement a **logistic regression model** as our predictive tool to address our first project goal. This model will help us determine the likelihood of stroke occurrence based on the identified risk factors. By analyzing these relationships, we aim to accurately predict which individuals are at a higher risk of experiencing a stroke.

## Research Questions

Our first research question focuses on determining:

-   What are the most significant risk factors associated with stroke?

Furthermore, as we develop a logistic regression model, we also seek to assess its predictive accuracy. Therefore, our second research question is:

-   How accurately can a logistic regression model predict the occurrence of having a stroke?

## Adjustments or Refinements

Our initial exploratory data analysis shows relatively modest associations between stroke and most risk factors. To address this issue, we plan to use a demographically stratified approach in the predictive analysis. Additionally, due to the dataset's low proportion of stroke cases, upsampling was necessary to prevent bias in the predictive model.
