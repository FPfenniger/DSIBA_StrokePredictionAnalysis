  This project investigates stroke prediction using logistic regression to identify individuals at heightened risk of stroke. Utilizing a structured classification framework, we analyze a dataset containing various patient health metrics, with stroke occurrence as the target variable. Our data preparation process includes preprocessing to address missing values, feature scaling, handling potential outliers and encoding categorical variables. The current EDA shows that the dataset is imbalanced, with only 4.9% of individuals having a stroke. We address this issue by oversampling the minority class. Furthermore, our predictive variables exhibit only weak to moderate correlations with our target variable with age being the strongest one. We then build a 4 distinct logistic models, each with different feature selection. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings and suggest potential improvements.
