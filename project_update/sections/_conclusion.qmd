# Conclusion

## Progress Summary
Overall, we completed the data cleaning and preprocessing of our dataset, which is now ready for predictive modeling. The EDA revealed lower correlations between some features and the target variable than anticipated, but we identified meaningful patterns. For instance, the target variable (stroke occurrence) is more likely to be positive among older individuals and those with higher average glucose levels. Additionally, to gain further insights, we plan to explore the balanced and stratified datasets, which may reveal patterns that were less apparent in the original dataset.

## Next Steps
Our immediate next step is to extend our EDA to the balanced and stratified datasets. This will help us understand the distribution of the target variable more clearly across different demographic and health-related groups, particularly age. Following this, we will develop several predictive models, starting with logistic regression, and assess their performance. We anticipate that our stratified dataset may improve model accuracy. A key focus will be comparing model performance across different sampling methods, aiming to select the best approach for predicting stroke occurrence. 

## Final Thoughts
We are a bit surprised and disappointed by the low correlation between the features and the target variable. However, we are confident that we can still build a good predictive model. Furthermore, we are excited to see how our models will perform and to see if we can predict the likelihood of having a stroke based on the features we have. We are also looking forward to exploring the feature importance and understanding which features are the most important in predicting the target variable. Also the comparison between the models will be interesting.
