# Conclusion

## Progress Summary
Overall, we completed the data cleaning of our dataset, which is now ready to be used for predictive modeling. The EDA showed that correlations are a bit lower than expected, but we were able to identify some interesting patterns. For example, we found that the target variable is more likely to be positive for people who are older and have a higher average glucose level. 

## Next Steps
First, we plan to extend our EDA to the stratified dataset, which will allow us to better understand the distribution of the target variable across different age groups. The next step will be to build several predictive models based on logistic regression and evaluate the results and final representations. We hope to increase accuracy with the use of our stratified datasets. 

## Final Thoughts
We are excited to see how our models will perform and to see if we can predict the likelihood of having a stroke based on the features we have. We are also looking forward to exploring the feature importance and understanding which features are the most important in predicting the target variable.
