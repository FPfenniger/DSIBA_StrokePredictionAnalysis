# Introduction

## Project Goals

Stroke is a leading global health issue, causing long-term disability and claiming millions of lives each year. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 15 million people worldwide experience a stroke annually, with 5 million deaths and an additional 5 million left with permanent disabilities. A stroke is a medical emergency that occurs when blood flow to a part of the brain is interrupted, depriving brain cells of oxygen and nutrients and causing them to die. This disruption can be caused by a blockage (ischemic stroke) or by bleeding in the brain (hemorrhagic stroke). The impact is particularly significant given that stroke can lead to loss of mobility, speech, and cognitive function, affecting individualsâ€™ quality of life and creating burdens for families and communities.

This project aims to explore associations between key risk factors and stroke incidence using data analysis and predictive modeling.

## Research Questions

What are the most significant risk factors associated with stroke?
Can we predict the likelihood of a stroke in a given patient based on their characteristics?
How does the relative importance of each risk factor influence the predictive model?

These questions are linked to data variables such as age, gender, hypertension, diabetes, and lifestyle factors like smoking status, which collectively offer insights into stroke risk patterns.

## Adjustments or Refinements

Our initial explorative data analysis shows relatively modest associations between stroke and most risk factors. To address this issue, we plan to use a stratified model in the predictive analysis based on demographics. Furthermore, an upsampling was required as the proportion of individuals with stroke was relatively low in the dataset.
