# Introduction

## Project Goals

Stroke is a leading global health issue, causing long-term disability and claiming millions of lives each year. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 15 million people worldwide experience a stroke annually, with 5 million deaths and an additional 5 million left with permanent disabilities. A stroke is a medical emergency that occurs when blood flow to a part of the brain is interrupted, depriving brain cells of oxygen and nutrients and causing them to die. This disruption can be caused by a blockage (ischemic stroke) or by bleeding in the brain (hemorrhagic stroke). The impact is particularly significant given that strokes can lead to loss of mobility, speech, and cognitive function, affecting individuals’ quality of life and creating burdens for families and communities.

This project aims to explore associations between key risk factors and stroke incidence using data analysis and predictive modeling.

## Research Questions

1. What are the most significant risk factors associated with stroke?
2. How accurately can a machine learning model predict an individual’s likelihood of having a stroke based on these factors?
3. How do specific risk factors, such as age, heart disease, and glucose levels, interact to influence stroke risk?

These questions focus on data features such as age, gender, hypertension, diabetes, and lifestyle factors like smoking status, offering insights into stroke risk patterns.

## Adjustments or Refinements

Our initial exploratory data analysis shows relatively modest associations between stroke and most risk factors. To address this issue, we plan to use a demographically stratified approach in the predictive analysis. Additionally, due to the dataset's low proportion of stroke cases, upsampling was necessary to prevent bias in the predictive model.
